# Cheated Lottery 2

_Author: [TheArqsz](https://github.com/TheArqsz)


I am an admin of this lottery and I found my mistakes in the code - I fixed them before my boss could see them. Unfortunately no one can win now - small price for not being fired. Need to fix this ASAP...

## Challenge

Flag is stored in `bm9wZS1ub3QtaGVyZS4uLm9yIGlzIGl0Pwo` database - you need to read it using SQLi

To run this you have to change flag in `entrypoint.sh` and build a docker image. Server will be exposed on port 7331
