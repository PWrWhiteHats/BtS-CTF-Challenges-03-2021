When you look at description, first letters in verses are creating "GHUNT". It is hint, that GHunt tool can be used. GHunt need email in google domain, so you can use it on name thomas.garminas@gmail.com. It will show you one account linked to Youtube. There is one video with date and in the description of youtube channel you can see, that it is something about a concert. In the description of challenge it is said, that memories are from Moscow. So You need just pull these hints together into google.com and find correct band
