## how to use

There is Dockerfile that should work out-of-the-box. Scripts handles multiple connections itself, but I don't know how well it performs under pressure. Probably you can use some fancy dockery to do load-balancing or something.

## flag

there is a flag `BtS-CTF{6a6ec1bda97401bd1a0f5d6fd18a0bf9}` in `games.rb`. You can change that to something you more like.

## solution

There is a really nice [WRITE_UP.md](./solution/README.md.md) in this directory describing what to do. There is also `solution.rb` that implments thing described in WRITE_UP.
